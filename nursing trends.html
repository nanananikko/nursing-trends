<p>Job growth is comparable to what happens in economy, with the function of supply and demand. When the COVID-19 affected the whole world, the demand for nurses also increased because of the knowledge and awareness in terms of health the pandemic brought. Nurses, who have been like the strong support helping many of us and our loved ones get better and stay well, are now being called "healthcare heroes" by everyone. They are getting more respect from the public because of their important role during the pandemic. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the growth rate for nurse practitioners is increasingly much faster than the average by 40%.</p>

<p>The pandemic brought about many unexpected problems, and one of them is the worsening shortage of nurses across the country. Even though this lack of nurses is a serious issue, it has created a chance for a new group of people who are interested in finding new passions and want to answer a calling to help others by becoming nurses. A number of 91,938 qualified applicants were turned away from nursing programs in the school year 2021-2022, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.</p>
<p>It is said that the main reason for this is the insufficient preceptors and clinical sites for denying the admissions. Top reason is also the shortage of faculty that is supposedly to train these qualified applicants.</p>

<p>The BLS projects that approximately 194,500 openings for registered nurses will be available each year until 2030. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), the shortage of registered nurses will only grow as our population continues to age and demand for healthcare expands. The AACN notes that a shortage of nursing school faculty and more nurses reaching retirement age also are exacerbating the issue. According to one survey, other reason for the shortage of nursing staff is that nurses quit due to the nurse burnout and high-stress environment with underpaid salaries as reasons.</p>
